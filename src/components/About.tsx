        Hello! I'm Fajar Aziz Kurniawan, currently studying at Universitas Dian Nuswantoro, Semarang. I am a full-stack TypeScript developer with a
        strong focus on backend development. My passion lies in creating scalable, efficient systems by working with server-side technologies,
        databases, and API integrations. While I am proficient across the full stack, backend architecture and problem-solving are where I excel. I
        enjoy collaborating with others and believe in the power of teamwork to solve complex problems. I'm always eager to learn and improve,
        exploring new technologies to enhance my skills. With a dedication to continuous growth, I look forward to contributing to impactful projects
        in the tech industry.
